Big Mumma's Fried Chicken

"Big Mama’s first Fried Chicken recipe was created in 1921 when she was preparing delicious food for her Grandchildren; Antony and DeShawn. Her recipe hasn’t changed since. To this day we use the secret and trademark recipe that Big Mumma first used many moons ago.

At Big Mumma’s, we are secretive. For now, you won’t find our storefront. The only way you can get your hands on our awesome chicken is to get it delivered to your door. Big Mumma’s trademark recipe is multi-award winning at the Louisiana State Fair & Louisiana Chicken Farmers Association.  "
